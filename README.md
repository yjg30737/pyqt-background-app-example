PyQt background app example with system tray icon

## How to do
1. git clone ~
2. python main.py

## Detailed Description
Window has nothing. blank empty screen. That's not the point. You can just make random widgets over it to your heart's content.

The point is app does not stop if you measly close the window.

You have to manually right click the system tray icon and click the "Quit".

You can make the window reappear when you click the system tray icon.

TL;DR very basic sample of background app.
